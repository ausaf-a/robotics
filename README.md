# Modules 

## Pathfinding 
Implemented rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm to find a path around obstacles to the target 

## Particle Filter
Implemented particle filter algorithm to localize the robot using ArUco markers placed around the arena 

## PID 
Implemented and tuned a PID control loop for the position of the robot in order to reach a rapid stop when an obstacle is detected.
